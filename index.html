      <h2>The First Computer</h2>
      <a href="https://ethw.org/ENIAC">Faster Than A Man?</a>
      <p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer, better known as ENIAC was the first large-scale “computer” to run at speed no human could. It is described as “a collection of electronic adding machines and other arithmetic units,
        controlled by a web of large electrical cables,” says David Grier, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. It ran more calculations than all of mankind at that point. </p>
      <p>In 1943-1946 at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania the ENIAC was constructed. The principal designers, J. Presper Eckert, an electrical engineer at the Moore School, and John Mauchly, a physicist who became interested in
        calculating devices from statistical methods. The purpose of this super computer was to be a quick computing machine designed to compute ballistic tables within a short amount of time. However, the war ended before the machine was fully
        operational, but was able to solve a problem for the hydrogen-bomb project.</p>

      <h2>WiFi</h2>
      <a href="https://www.spectrum.com/wifi-hotspots.html">Faster Than Light?</a>
      <p>WiFi has played a major role in keeping us connected at home and in the public. We regularly rely on WiFi to maintain our productivity, organization, and some even use it for protection and health. WiFi Access Points are set up at home and in many local places. It gives internet access to everything ranging from laptops to tablets to smartphones.  WiFi first hit the scenes in in 1997 created by a group called 802.11. As the years progress, it has advanced into a stronger and faster speed that covers more distance than the earlier versions.</p>
      <p>It is more than just simply going on online to browse social media or surf the web, it has also made multiple electronics become interconnected and exchange information back and forth.  Undeniable, WiFi is no longer a one way street. We now connect in our personal and professional lives. It is constantly improving our efficiency and communication and pressing against the boundaries of what’s next to come in the future.</p>
